<h2>Meet Annette Shannon!</h2>    
       <p>
    Annette has been involved with dog training since she adopted her first rescue dog in 1992. Annette emphasizes modern, positive training utilizing clicker and verbal markers to teach a behavior to earn positive reinforcement. Annette works with dogs and their people on a wide range of behavior issues. She would like to work with the dogs from puppy to adult but sometimes that is not always the case. She specializes in rescues or everyday problems that might arise with your dog.
    </p> 
    <p>Annette's agility training philosophy focuses on fun, play, focus and working as a team with your dog to reach whatever level that you would like to accomplish. Annette taught at a local dog club before starting her own business with her husband Forrest in 2007. Annette started competing in agility with her English Cocker Spaniel and achieved Agility titles on Cooper before deciding to work with Australian Shepherds in agility. Annette enjoys the challenge of training with working Aussies. Agility is a fun sport whether you want to just have fun with your dog or continue to excel so you can compete.</p>

 <p>"Annette Shannon came to our home in Eagle Ridge to meet our Tasmanian devil/rocketship Labradoodle, Hannah. We were so exhausted and irritated as she had already eaten thousands of dollars.
<br><br>
Within about 90 minutes of Annette training us, we were amazed to meet and now love the new Hannah who consistently wants to be the best dog ever. Now we can enjoy her in our home without fear or financial ruin. It was the best dog gone money we ever spent."
</p>
<strong><p>&mdash; Sincerely, Lori and Rick</p></strong>
